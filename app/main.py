        "associate them into events and locate them with weighted least squares "
        "against versioned 1-D layered velocity models. Per-station P/S arrival "
        "calibrations can be estimated from historical events and atomically "
        "activated; process/replay requests may then correct arrivals before "
        "location. A cross-run catalog deterministically merges the same "
        "earthquake's events from multiple completed runs into immutable, "
        "lifecycle-managed catalog entries (draft/published/withdrawn). A "
        "station impact audit freezes one completed event and re-runs "
        "association/location after removing each participating station's P/S "
        "picks, flagging the key stations. A catalog alert orchestration layer "
        "lets administrators publish immutable alert rule versions over the "
        "published catalog and evaluate catalog compilations into "
        "deterministic, mergeable alert events with a full audit chain. A "
        "P-wave first-motion focal mechanism inversion grid-searches "
        "double-couple strike/dip/rake on a 10-degree grid for a completed "
        "event's associated P polarities, keeping every minimum-misfit "
        "mechanism with plane-swap duplicates removed but the "
        "slip-reversed (-M) mechanism retained as a separate candidate. An "
        "event location uncertainty assessment freezes a completed event's "
        "associated picks, weights, velocity model and calibration version, "
        "then bootstrap-relocates it on seeded with-replacement station "
        "resamples, reporting nearest-rank confidence intervals, the "
        "solvable-only sample covariance and the solvable rate. A station "
        "P-wave pick gap assessment takes a catalog compilation id plus an "
        "arrival tolerance and minimum observable event count, considers only "
        "the entries already published at submission (each once via its master "
        "run/event), predicts P arrivals with that run's velocity model and "
        "station-P calibration offset, requires the ingested waveform to fully "
        "cover the predicted instant +/- tolerance, then marks manual-P or "
        "STA/LTA matches as hits (manual S never matches) and the rest as "
        "gaps, reporting per-station observable/gap counts and gap rates "
        "(with evidence-insufficient flags) plus paginated per-event evidence."
